CS Research Symposium
=======================

.. note:: This is in draft status. The plan is to launch in January 2022.

The CS Research Symposium is an annual event, typically scheduled at the end of Spring semester.
With the COVID-19 pandemic, there continues to be uncertainty about large gatherings.
Nevertheless, we are now moving to a model where submissions will be accepted continuously throughout the year.
There will also be *friendly reminders* around midterm each semester to encourage submissions to CSRS.

Submission Types
-------------------

- full-length research paper

  - A full paper submission is expected to be a substantial work that may well be expanded into a workshop, conference, or journal submission, typically involving one or more undergraduate/gradaute students and one or more faculty members.
  - Papers not involving department faculty members should be submitted to the technical report category.
  - These submissions will be reviewed by at least 2 faculty to determine suitability for inclusion as a research paper.
  - Accepted research papers are required to produce a 10-minute video for the annual symposium.


- technical report

  - A technical report may have the seeds of a research paper but is primarily focused on implementation. 
  - Technical reports typically address work performed during independent study or an internship and may/may not be suitable for submission in workshops, conferences, or journals.
  - This category is for those who have conducted work without any mentoring/supervision.
  - These submissions are reviewed primarily for technical soundness, style, and clarity.
  - Accepted technical reports may optionally include a 5-minute video for the annual symposium.

  
- demonstration

  - Demonstrations are primarily foucsed on presentation as opposed to writing a paper.
  - Demonstrations typically address work performed during independent study or an internship and may/may not be suitable for submission in workshops, conferences, or journals.
  - This category is for those who have conducted work without any mentoring/supervision.
  - Accepted technical reports may optionally include a 5-minute video for the annual symposium.


- posters

  - Posters are primarily foucsed on display as opposed to a paper or a presentation.
  - Posters can either be independent efforts or teamwork involving other students and faculty. 
  - Accepted posters may optionally include a 5-minute video for the annual symposium.


Requirements
--------------

- Regardless of the submission type, the work submitted must include all who were involved in creating the work.

- Reesarch papers must be prepared using one of the `IEEE Templates <https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/tagged/ieee>`__ (or a LaTeX template suitable for conferences/journals in your faculty member's research area.)

- Technical reports are strongly encouraged to use the `ArXiv tempalte <https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/tagged/arxiv>`__. You may use Word or Google Docs but must make every attempt to ensure a professional appearance with consistent formatting.

- Demonstrations should be made available in an appropriate video format (.ogg, .mp4)

- Posters may be prepared using any desired tool.

How to Submit
---------------

- Once you have created your document and/or videos, use a service such as Figshare or ArXiv to upload your paper.

- Your submission must include all appropriate bibliographic data, starting with your own name, co-authors, including other students/faculty who worked with you.

- Submit your entry to the Digital Commons CSRS collection. **[coming soon]**

- Submissions will be reviewed by the committee for inclusion in the collection and for presentation at the annual celebration. If live, authors are invited to participate in the Q&A session after their video is presented at the annual celebration.
