Supervision Models
==================

These will be fleshed out.

Directed Reading - A literature based independent study, perhaps in
support of a thesis, where the student reads in an area suggested by a
faculty member. The beginnings of a “literature review” or “survey”
paper is expected.

Bring your own Project - Light Supervision

Students often want to do their own thing. This is fine but requires a
bit more process in place to ensure successful completion. This type of
project is proposal driven. There’s an approval process to ensure the
topic is sound. Then there are interim milestones/deliverables. A draft
report or demonstration is due a few weeks before the end of term to
allow for proper feedback. Then a final report and demonstration are
given. This option is also suitable for online students in our growing
portfolio of online offerings.

General Research - Medium Supervision

This is where a student is working closely with a faculty member to
solve a research problem.

Similar to the previous case there are milestones/deliverables.

Funded Research - Intense Supervision

This is where a faculty member has received funding. The student will
usually be suported on the grant.
