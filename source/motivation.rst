Why Research in CS at LUC?
==========================

The reasons for performing research are as diverse as the projects, but
there are often a number of advantages student describe beyond their
typical undergraduate curriculum.

-  **Develop** a project beyond what you started as a course project

-  **Impact** in the the scientific and technical community in small,
       focussed pursuits or through expansive reviews of existing
       approaches

-  **More in-depth advising** through a closer, mutually beneficial
       relationship with faculty

-  **Building practical skills** through more substantial, hands-on
       training

-  **Demonstrate** your abilities to future employers or programs with a
       significant, completed project representing your skills and
       efforts

-  **Engage in collaborative efforts** necessary to forward goals that
       can only be done with long-term sustained group efforts.

Computer science is a unique field where a simple idea can become a
start-up reality or a popular online open source project through
focussed, sustained effort alone. Your time at Loyola is a valuable
opportunity to pursue these projects through guidance by faculty and
collaboration with other enthusiastic students. You have resources
available at Loyola that you would not have without significant upfront
investment later - take the opportunity while you can.
