Loyola CS Research Opportunities
===================================

Projects are the bread and butter of the CS experience. Beyond the
learning experience and credit you receive they are often uniquely fun
and rewarding. And don't forget, we always celebrate projects at the end
of each semester with quick presentations after the end-of-semester
party.

COMP 398/490: Independent Study
---------------------------------

See `COMP 398/490: <http://academics.cs.luc.edu/courses/comp398.html>`__ in the
Course Handbook for details.

If you want to pursue a project outside the scope of a class, this is
the most likely route to receiving credit toward graduation. It's also
the simplest way to receive significant advising, as many projects are
collaborations with faculty who also maintain related resources.

You sign up for a COMP 398 (undergrad) or 490 (grad) after discussion
with the faculty member you will partner with - criteria for working on
these differ slightly among faculty by design, but here's a helpful
orientation, since independent study typically comes in two flavors.
Some faculty will only take independent study students who are
interested in contributing to long-term research efforts, generally
aimed at producing results available to the wider academic community -
often team efforts requiring more than a semester from start to finish
so your efforts will often be a piece of a larger project. Another
common option is developing an independent study for a personal project
or independent learning experience, however note that often these
efforts must be independent efforts with less faculty involvement, so
establishing clear goals and criteria for completion are the student's
responsibility.

To pursue an independent study project, first consider if you have the
required experience to pursue a project of interest - often it is best
to do independent study projects after foundational courses are out of
the way. Second, if you have an idea of your project goals, contact the
relevant faculty member. Once you have mutually agreeable goals, you
will be enrolled through an email send to the department.

Note: There are also the occasional COMP 388/488 research courses
(always with "Research" in the title) which serve a similar purpose to
research-based independent study COMP 398/490 courses. Contact the
instructor of these courses for how they may or may not differ from
typical COMP 398/490's if you are interested.

COMP 388-X: Research Methods in CS (1 credit hour)
-----------------------------------------------------

.. todo:: We need an entry in the course handbook for this.

The spring research seminar supplements the CS department seminar
(currently on alternate fridays at 12:30pm) by specifically aiming at
students who will directly engage in research and to facilitate their
contributions in their ongoing projects. This course is designed to
emphasize the tools and techniques in research collaboration, analysis,
and presentation to help project groups outside the course to focus on
content. Progress is encouraged and tracked in projects outside the
course through milestones such as abstracts, small fellowship-style
proposals, informal updates, and outcome-oriented goal setting where
appropriate.

COMP 390: Computer Science Seminar
--------------------------------------

See `COMP 399: <http://academics.cs.luc.edu/courses/comp399.html>`__ for
details.

The CS seminar is an opportunity to engage with other students as well
as the various speakers and events supported by the CS department,
usually on Fridays at 12:30pm. Past seminars include internal faculty
speakers and external speakers focusing on Big Data analytics, spatial
statistics, and STEM outreach opportunities. Every semester the seminar
supports a local competition, recently with a Loyola hackathon
competition in the Fall and a Datafest analytics competition in the
Spring. Requirements include reasonable attendance expectations and
brief writeups about your experiences.

Engaged Learning Courses
---------------------------

These are courses specifically with a project-oriented or applied
learning focus, satisfying the engaged learning requirement for
undergrads at Loyola. Here are the typical engaged learning courses in
CS.

The following courses (with their course handbook links) are all
Engaged Learning courses that encourage capstone projects as an
outcome:

- `*COMP 398/490: Independent Study* <http://academics.cs.luc.edu/courses/comp398.html>`__ Independent Study. This is standard for these courses.

- `*COMP 312/412: Open Souce Practicum* <http://academics.cs.luc.edu/courses/comp312.html>`__ Open Source Software - available Fall and Spring.

- `*COMP 390: Brodeaning Participation in STEM* <http://academics.cs.luc.edu/courses/comp390.html>`__ Broadening participation in STEM - available in the Fall.

- `*COMP 391/499* <http://academics.cs.luc.edu/courses/comp391.html>`__: Internship - available year round

- UNIV 102-X: Intro to CS research for freshmen - FYRE program (Spring)

.. todo:: need link to UNIV 102-X description.

This course will introduce students to the project-focused environment
that is part of a typical undergraduate student experience in computer
science. In CS, interesting projects are performed as group projects in
courses, independent study research experiences with faculty, or in
collaboration with industry partners. By selectively coordinating with
the biweekly Loyola CS seminar (COMP 399) and the concurrent research
methods course (COMP 388), students will have a chance to both observe
interesting work and learn some of the tools used in performing those
projects.

LUROP (Undergraduate Research)
---------------------------------


`LUROP <http://luc.edu/lurop/>`__ began as the umbrella under which several
undergraduate research programs at Loyola were promoted, supported, and
administered.  There are currently thirteen different LUROP fellowship
programs that offer undergraduates an opportunity to conduct research under a
mentor, who may be a faculty member, a graduate student, or a community
partner, depending on the program.  These fellowships also offer excellent
opportunities for faculty members and others to mentor young researchers,
which is the heart of the LUROP experience.  Many of these fellowships predate
LUROP, and twelve are directly administered by their own centers, departments,
or directors. Together, they are centrally coordinated by the Center for
Experiential Learning in the Sullivan Center at the Lake Shore Campus, which
also directly manages the Provost Fellowship.  For more information, and
directions for applying, see the page for the LUROP Fellowships.

We *encourage* our students to apply for the LUROP programs. We are routinely
contacted to ensure that our students know about this program and apply. Our
students often do well when competing for these awards, and this is a great
way to get support for working with your CS department profesors.
